   <h3>CIS 706/801: Translator Design I & II, Fall 2020</h3>

----

.. include:: def.rst

Purpose
*******

The course will teach modern compiler techniques applied to general-purpose
programming language.
The goal of the course is to give students a working knowledge of the
foundations, tools, and engineering approaches used in developing formal
language translators.
The emphasis is on the construction of compilers to position students to build
translators for little languages in their careers.


Course Topics
*************

Compilers and interpreters, including description of languages, finite state
scanners, parsing, symbol tables, syntax directed semantics, code generation,
and static analysis.


Philosophy
**********

This course is based on a course that was originally designed by
|Laurie J. Hendren| and |Michael I. Schwartzbach| which has been taught at a
number of universities over the past decade.
The course received a significant update by |Robby| and |Matthew B. Dwyer| in
2005 with respect to the projects and the tools that are used for compiler
implementation; this update achieves a modernization of compiler construction
technologies.
This is primarily an introductory compiling course that has been designed to
recognize that most people will not build a large application like a compiler
from scratch and that people learn by doing.
Towards this end, the project for the course involves the enhancement of an
existing compiler code base.
Students will be given a working compiler and will be required to extend it in
significant ways.
This will give them insights into how a compiler is designed and written that
they can leverage for their enhancements.
While serving this purpose, the course does present significantly more content
on static analysis than is typically found in an introductory compiling course;
thus it can serve as an effective introduction on advanced topics for graduate
students.

Grading Policy
**************

The course :ref:`schedule` page gives the due dates for all of the homework.
This is to facilitate your planning and time-management.
Given this, we expect assignments to be turned in on the due date unless prior
arrangements have been made; late assignments receive a reduction of 1% of the
total possible points for each hour after the due date/time.


Grading Scale
*************

Course grades are absolute, that is, there is no curve, and will be calculated
based on your overall percentage on assignments as follows:

* A: 90% -- 100%

* B: 80% -- 89%

* C: 70% -- 79%

* D: 60% -- 69%

* F: below 60%

There is one additional constraint on your final grade.
To receive a letter grade of A, you must achieve at least a B on the exam.
Similarly, to receive a B you must achieve a C, C you must achieve a D on the
exam. 


Computer Access
***************

This course involves a lot of programming, and it makes significant use of 
software tools. 
Many of these can be accessed by you (for free) and installed on your own 
machine.
If you prefer, we have everything you need on our CIS department machines so you
can get an account on our machines.
See the :ref:`notes` page for information on how to get an account and use our
machines.


Attendance Policy
*****************

In general, there will be NO make-up quizzes or exams!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:

* **Emergencies:** death in student's immediate family, or 
  near-death experience of the student.

* **Non-emergencies:** certified excused absences for official university activities.

If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the quiz or exam to be missed.


Statement Regarding Academic Honesty
************************************

Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient
assurance in academic matters one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance.
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor & Integrity System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and
graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.

A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the
`Honor Pledge <https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html>`__
which applies to all assignments,
examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
**"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."**

The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance
of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final.
If you are in doubt, please ask.

A `grade of XF <https://www.k-state.edu/honor/faculty-tips/policy-agreement.html>`__
can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

Statement Defining Expectations for Classroom Conduct
*****************************************************

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the
`Student Judicial Conduct Code <https://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/>`__ as outlined in the Student Governing Association
`By Laws <https://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf>`__,
Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to
leave the class.


Statement Regarding Wearing of Face Coverings
*********************************************

To protect the health and safety of the K-State community, students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear face
coverings over their mouths and noses while on K-State campuses in all hallways, public spaces, classrooms and other
common areas of campus buildings, and when in offices or other work spaces or outdoor settings when 6-feet social
distancing cannot be maintained.
In addition, all students, faculty, and staff are required to take the
`COVID-19 and Face Mask Safety training <https://www.k-state.edu/safety/covid-19/training/>`__.
Employees who need reasonable accommodations and assistance related to required face coverings may contact the ADA
coordinator at charlott@k-state.edu, and students needing accommodations may contact the
`Student Access Center <https://www.k-state.edu/accesscenter/>`__ at accesscenter@k-state.edu.

In classrooms, faculty have the right to deny a student entry into the room if the student is not wearing a face covering.
Students not wearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean face covering, if one is available.
If the student does not comply, the faculty member will ask the student to leave the space, and if available, join the
class remotely.
As a last resort, campus police will be called. The faculty members will complete the
`Code of Conduct form <https://www.k-state.edu/report/conduct-violation/>`__
and the `Office of Student Life <https://www.k-state.edu/report/conduct-violation/>`__
will look further into the issue and take the non-compliance with the request to leave into consideration of further
ccountability measures.

At no point should the professor or other students put themselves into an unsafe situation while attempting to enforce
the face-covering policy. Manhattan campus police: 785-532-6412.


Academic Freedom Statement
**************************

Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge,
create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public.
Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of
any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus
essential to any university's mission.

Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in
an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or
to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and
political questions.
It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.


Campus Safety Statement
***********************

Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty
members.
